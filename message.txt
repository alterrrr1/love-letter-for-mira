#to my beloved Miraku sayangg

i just wanted to take a moment to remind you of how much you mean to me. every time when i see your smile, my heart races like its the first time i’ve ever laid eyes on you. you light up my world in ways i never thought possible, and i am so thankful to have you in my life.

being with you has made me realize how amazing love can be. your kindness, your laughter, and the way you care for me—it all fills me with a happiness i can’t quite put into words. you’re not just the love of my life, but also my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest source of joy.

i want you to know that no matter what happens, i will always be here for you. i will stand by you, support you. you have a heart of gold, and i feel so lucky to be the one who gets to love you.

thank you for being you—just as you are. you make every day better, and my love for you only grows deeper with time.

last: when im with you, my mind is quiet, my thoughts are calm, and my heart is full
